#Lung Cancer Detection:
Using LUNA16 dataset:

paper Insights:
**Paper link**:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08324
->Used CT scans (computerized tomography)

Used two modules to classify the pulmonary nodules
1->Used 3D-CNN to detect the pulmonary nodules
2->Used Noisy-D and Leaky-Noisy Method to get the probability of pulmonary nodule, that could lead to CANCER

-->nodule size < 6mm were ignored as they cannot cause cancer according to the doctors
-->all the nodules in the dataset were carefully checked by the doctor and written their traits

#Lung and colon Cancer Classification:
Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images
->Used Histopathological Images
->5 classes
	Lung benign tissue
    Lung adenocarcinoma
    Lung squamous cell carcinoma
    Colon adenocarcinoma
    Colon benign tissue

Used Models such as VGG19-CNN, ResNet152V2, ResNet152V2 + Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and ResNet152V2 + Bidi-rectional GRU (Bi-GRU)
VGG-19 model given optimal results
